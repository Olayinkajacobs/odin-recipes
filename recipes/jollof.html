    <h3>Steps In Cooking Jollof Rice:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>For the Stew Base:</strong> Blend tomatoes, red bell pepper,
        onion, Scotch bonnet or habanero, and broth in a blender pitcher. Puree
        until a velvety mixture develops, approximately 2 minutes. This will
        result in nearly 5 cups (1.18L) of liquid.
      </li>

      <li>
        Move the base of the stew into a 3-quart saucier or saucepan, partly
        cover it with a lid to prevent splattering, and heat it until it reaches
        a boiling point on medium-high heat. Lower the heat to a medium-low
        setting and simmer, while occasionally stirring and scraping the bottom,
        until it is reduced by half (approximately 2 1/2 cups; 590ml) - this
        should take about 30 minutes. Take off the heat and keep it aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>For the Jollof Rice:</strong> In a 4- or 5-quart pot or Dutch
        oven, heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over medium heat until shimmering.
        Add half the sliced onion along with the bay leaves, curry powder, dried
        thyme, a large pinch of salt, and a large pinch of black or white
        pepper. Cook, stirring, until the mixture is fragrant and the onions
        soften slightly, about 3 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir in tomato paste and 2 teaspoons (8g) butter. Cook, stirring
        continuously, until the tomato paste darkens, about 3 minutes. Stir in
        reserved stew base, cover partially with the lid to prevent splattering,
        and cook at a gentle simmer over medium-low heat until reduced by half,
        about 15 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir in stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Season with salt and
        pepper; if the curry flavor is lacking, you can add more to taste (the
        curry powder should come through pleasantly but not be overpowering,
        though this is a question of personal taste).
      </li>
      <img src="./Images/stew4.jpg" />
      <li>
        Stir in rice until evenly coated in sauce. Cover the pot with a double
        piece of foil or parchment paper, crimped down around the edges to seal,
        then top with lid (this will trap steam to lock in the flavor and aid
        cooking). Reduce the heat to the lowest possible and cook for 20
        minutes, then uncover pot and gently stir rice to redistribute. Cover
        again and continue to cook until rice is just cooked through but still
        retains a firm bite and the liquid is mostly absorbed, about 15 minutes
        longer. If rice is undercooked and/or still wet, cover and cook 5
        minutes longer.
      </li>

      <li>
        Combine the sliced tomato with the remaining sliced onion and the
        remaining 1 teaspoon (4g) of butter, stirring until the butter is
        completely melted.
      </li>
      <img src="./Images/stew6.jpg" />
      <li>
        Take off the heat, place a cover on top, and allow it to rest for 10
        minutes. Serve.
